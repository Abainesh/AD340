My name is Abainesh Abraha. You can call me Abby. I am new to the IT field and programming in general. I have been fascinated by technologies and computers in particular from the beginning, setting the field of computing vastly apart from other fields. I have always thrive on the challenge of puzzles and problems, and often find creative and original ways to deal with such things. I enjoy tackling situations where I am required to apply my knowledge systematically.
My technology backup plan is to complete my assigned homework assignments in advance by using time management skills which will give me enough time to trouble shoot my own machine and if that fails I can use campus computer lab or tutoring center computer.
